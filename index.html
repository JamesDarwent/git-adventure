    <h4>What is Git and why is it so important?</h4>
    <p> Git is a super popular version control system. Ultimately git records any changes made to our code over time. It allows us to track our projects, and if working in groups it will track who made changes (and why they made them). Also, if you royally balls it up, you can revert your project back to when the code was working correctly</p>

    <h4>What’s a branch and why do we create them?</h4>
    <p>Projects are usually run off the main (master) branch. If we want to make any changes to our code, creating a new branch will copy any data in the main branch, but essentially set it to one side so we can work on it seperately. This means any work conducted here won't affect the main branch. Once happy with our work, these changes are reviewed and merged into the master branch</p>

    <h4>What’s the working tree?</h4>
    <p>The working tree is essentially your working directory, a local directory where you can add and edit files on your device</p>

    <h4>What’s the staging area?</h4>
    <p>This is a intermidiate "middle man" area which allows us to decide which changes we eventually want to commit</p>

    <h4>What’s the command to retrieve the latest version of your files from the remote serve?</h4>  
    <p>git pull (REMOTE_NAME) (REMOTE_BRANCH_NAME). In my case this would usually be "git pull origin master"</p>
